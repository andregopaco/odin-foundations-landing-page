A website design during my journey with The Odin Project ("Foundations" part)

During this project, I'll have to use a lot of the content about CSS and HTML that I've learned so far. In particular, I'll need to use flexform to place everything properly on screen. To start the project, I'll have only a couple of reference images, which will be linked in the folder called 'reference-imgs'. Well, for now, good luck to me!

Update after finishing main layout (took me a whole day, at least, to finish it). 
Thoughts and ideas that come to me now:

- I guess I used to many divs and flex containers?
- I still don't know exactly how to avoid shrinkage of some parts of the website.
- It was fulfilling to see the webpage completed and looking really similar to the original image.
- Maybe I'll personalize it? To do so, I'd want to branch the repo (got to learn how to do it);
- My CSS file is pretty confusing. Maybe I should try to order it in a more intuitive way the next time?
