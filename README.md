# odin-foundations-landing-page
A website design during my journey with The Odin Project ("Foundations" part)

During this project, I'll have to use a lot of the content about CSS and HTML that I've learned so far. In particular, I'll need to use flexform to place everything properly on screen. To start the project, I'll have only a couple of reference images, which will be linked in the folder called 'reference-imgs'. Well, for now, good luck to me!
